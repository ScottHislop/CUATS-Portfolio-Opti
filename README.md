# Alpha combination - First draft
This Jupyter notebook details a simple first attempt at combining alphas. It is by no means an "optimal" strategy, but is reasonable and can be used as a baseline to compare alternative strategies (i.e. using ML).

Firstly, we import the data from a set of log files. These can be generated by adding the code from the Appendix to the bottom of the initialization function in the main class of a QC algorithm.

We also make dataframes storing the daily percentage change, and the correlations between different stocks for comparison.

Next, we compute the Equal weighted and Markowitz Portfolio theory based returns, determining their sharpe ratios and plotting them. Here we demonstrate some evidence for Markowitz Portfolio Optimization being better than an Equally weighted alternative.

Lastly, we discuss some future additions that could be made to improve the strength and reliability of our findings.
